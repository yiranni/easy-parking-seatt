Hassle-free parking starts here!

Seattle traffic is a growing issue in the city. This web application, Easy Parking Seattle, allows you to easily view street parking spaces with the touch of a button. 

## Map

You can search for a Point of Interest and find street parking close to it.

For each parking station, you will be able to view its location, hours and rates, and comments.

## About

You can learn more about the founders of this web application on their personal websites.

The parking data is retrieved from Seattle GeoData.
